       <p style="text-align:center;font-size:150%"> We asked hundreds of parents how they manage (and don’t manage) their kids’ screen time. The answers were candid, scary–and sometimes hopeful.</p>

      <hr>
         <p>“I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as is my husband. It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies.<br/>
            Not wanting to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, holds it in his hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone.<br/>
            It is the cutest/most pathetic thing.”<br/>
          <p>Even as we learn about the potential pitfalls of our increasingly technology-addled lifestyles,<br/>
            our dependence on tech shows little sign of waning. Still, the anti-screen time drumbeat is getting louder,<br/>
            especially when it comes to kids.<br/>
          <p>In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early employee at Facebook,<br/>
             said that the social network was “ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.” Tristan Harris, a former product manager at Google,<br/>
              told Wired that Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram design products to “hijack” our time and attention. In January,<br/>
               two Apple investors asked the company to study the health effects of its products on children.<br/>
          <p>Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former employees from some the most powerful tech companies–including Apple,<br/>
             Google, and Facebook–formed the Center for Humane Technology. In partnership with the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media,<br/>
              the group plans to lobby against addictive tech, and is kicking off with a $7 million “Truth about Tech” ad campaign that they plan to deliver to 55,000 public schools.<br/>

            That the very people who championed the technology to which we are addicted are now banding together to warn parents about the monster<br/>
            they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are starting to question tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad campaign,<br/>
            no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail our society’s addiction–especially when kids these days are being introduced to screens at such a young age. In her book,<br/>
            The Art of Screen Time Anya Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds) that found that young kids spend about four hours a day in the company of (all types of) screens.<br/>
          <p>To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast Company surveyed nearly 400 parents. We tried to look at the issue from all angles,<br/>
             from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types of devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of technology,<br/>
              to the benefits that technology can provide to families. We also asked parents how they feel about witnessing their own tech addiction reflected in their kids’ behavior. Those were,<br/>
              perhaps, the most telling answers of all.<br/>
            <p>Obviously, this self-selected group of Fast Company readers isn’t a conclusive sample–but, along with expert research,<br/>
              these parents’ insights help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden parents in our tech-dependent era.<br/></hr>
